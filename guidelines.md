## Understanding the Role & Responsibilities

- The role is heavily backend-focused with some full-stack responsibilities. You should be comfortable with:

- [x] Node.js & NestJS: Be ready to discuss architecture, dependency injection, and modularization in NestJS.
- [] PostgreSQL: Query optimization, indexing strategies, and transactions.
- [x] Redis: Caching strategies, session management, and Pub/Sub.
- [x] Kafka: Message streaming, event-driven architectures, and handling high-throughput data.
- [x] CQRS & SOLID Principles: Be ready to explain CQRS and how it improves system design. Also, expect questions on applying SOLID principles in a real-world scenario.
- [x] Docker & Kubernetes: Containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD best practices.
- [] AWS: EC2, RDS, S3, and general cloud best practices.

## Technical Interview Prep

- [] Coding Challenge: Likely backend-focused, possibly involving API design with NestJS, database queries, or a distributed system problem. We can do some mock coding challenges to prepare.
- [] System Design: They might ask you to design a scalable backend system using NestJS, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis, and AWS. Practice explaining trade-offs between different architectures.
- [] Algorithm & Data Structures: Sorting, searching, caching strategies, and working with streaming data (Kafka).

## Behavioral & Communication Skills

- [] Past Experience: Be ready to discuss previous projects where you used these technologies.
- [] Mentoring & Code Reviews: Expect questions about how you guide junior developers and enforce best practices.
- [] Working with Product & Design Teams: How do you balance technical feasibility with business needs?
